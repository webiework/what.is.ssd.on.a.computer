A solid-state drive (SSD) is a new generation of storage device used in computers. SSDs use flash-based memory, which is much faster than a traditional mechanical hard disk. Upgrading to an SSD is one of the best ways to speed up your computer. Learn how SSDs work and how to keep them optimized with a specialized performance-boosting tool.


## What do solid-state drives do?

SSDs store data permanently on an integrated circuit, which is a collection of electronic circuits embedded within a silicon semiconductor cell. Sometimes referred to as semiconductor storage devices, SSDs are more commonly known as solid-state drives, because they donâ€™t have the moving parts found in hard-disk drives (HDD).
